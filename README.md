# What is it?

Galleri is an iOS app that allows users to take pictures and create photo albums which are directly saved in the cloud.
Users can make an album public and thus allow other user to contribute to it. Users can either invite specfic people or create 
a hashtag that other users can use as code to join that album.

# Example scenario

You, being the bold person you are, have decided that you are going to spend the next month backpacking through Europe.
You quickly realize it might be boring to do it alone. Thus you expertly swoon your friends into joining you on your adventure.
You soon realize that you and your friends will be taking many pictures. Unforunatley you all decided to buy the 16 GB iPhone
and no longer have room for all those pictures. You and your friends download the Galleri app and create a shared album.
Now all the pictures you and your friends take are save directly to the cloud in one shared album. No space is taken on your phone.
When you return from your adventure you download only the pictures you like to your phone.
